## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Diego TomÃ© and I am a Ph.D. student in the Database Architectures group at CWI-NL. My research interests include data compression, co-processing with GPUs and the usage of emerging hardware to accelerate queries. I am also a Software Engineer Intern at RelationalAI and I am helping a great team to build the worldâ€™s fastest, most scalable, most expressive, most open knowledge graph management system.

You can find a full list of my publications [here](https://diegomestre2.github.io/).
